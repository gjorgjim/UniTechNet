# UniTechNet - University graduation project

UniTechNet is a social network for students enrolled in electrical engineering courses.
The main idea is easily following content about specific courses like Calculus, Computer science etc. This is avalaible through a subscribe system that users can use; they subscribe to the courses they are enrolled in, and **follow**, **share** and **post** problems and answers specifically about that course. Besides this subscribe system for courses this social network, like every one out there has all the main features a proper social network should have: **messenger**, **feed** and **profile**.
